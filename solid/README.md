# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are five design principles for creating well-structured, maintainable, 
and scalable software. 

## S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only one reason to change.
 
Meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

## O: Open/Close Principle (OCP)

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for 
> modification.  

This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code since 
changing the existing code might introduce bugs.

### L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without 
> affecting the correctness of the program.

### I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
